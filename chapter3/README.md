Go is a statically typed and compiled language. Variables always have a specific type and that type cannot change. The code is compiled from source code to exectuable machine code.


Variable Types:
Numbers
- Integers `int`
- Floats `float64`

Strings
- Use double quotes or back ticks
- Double quotes cannot contain newlines and they allow special escape sequences

Booleans
